 * Write a recursive function treeToList(Node root) that takes a 
 * BST and rearranges the internal pointers to make a circular 
 * doubly linked list out of the tree nodes. The "previous" pointers
 * should be stored in the "Left" field and the "next" pointers should
 * be stored in the "Right" field. The list should be arranged so that
 * the nodes are in increasing order. Return the head pointer to the 
 * new list. The operation can be done in O(n) time.
